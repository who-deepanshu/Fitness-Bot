# Fitness Bot
- I have created this bot using an open source platform **BOTPRESS** for building next-generation chatbots and assistants powered by OpenAI.
- It gives a feature where you can just simply store your training data as a knowledge base on which it automatically train itself then you can ask questions to it on the basis of knowledge base we provided.
- We can also integrate it AI so that if the model was unable to find an answer from knowledge base then it can search from online source and give an appropriate answer.

# Knowledge Base
- I have given three document(txt) files as a knowledge base which contains information about :
   - Basic knowledge about body, fitness, diet, etc.
   - Weight loss diet plan.
   - Weight gain plan.
- I have also integrated it with AI so if it doesn't find any answer from knowledge base then it will search online.
- We can also give link to any website from where we want to fetch data it will automatically parse the site.

# Structure of Bot
- After all pre-processing the structure of Bot looks like as -

# Deploy
- I have created a demo portfolio website for myself which is incomplete yet. So, i decided to integrate the Fitness Bot with my demo site.
- I have used github pages online service to deploy it online where you check how Bot is working.
- Here is few screenshots when i chated with Fitness Bot.

<h4>It is a simple way i have used to create a chat-bot by using open source AI tools.</h4>
<h4>It answers reasonable amount of questions we ask. If, we want to make it more efficient or scalable then we have to provide more data in its knowledge base.</h4>
<h4>Here, i have learnt that how we can use these tools to make our work done with less efforts and also there is more to explore in it.</h4>
